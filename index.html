				<strong>
					Section 1 - Introduction
				</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				EpticMC is a Minecraft Server community and network. In addition to employing voluntary staff, we allow users the freedom to act the way they think is best. This system is designed to provide an organic environment for users, while maintaining a certain degree of control against violation of site rules.
				<br>
				<br>
				Therefore, while we do bestow several site rules, it’s up to the users to apply common sense to decide how they act. This structure is designed so that perpetrators will be punished within the social hierarchy of the community. Nonetheless, if you see content that violates any rule on this page, disagrees with your common interest, or has an inappropriate connotation; you are obliged to address it to our staff via the report button.
				<br>
				<br>
				By creating an account you acknowledge and agree to behave accordingly to the rules below.

				<strong>
					Section 2 - Forum Rules
				</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>
				<div class='tooltip'>
					<span class="def-span"><a data-ref='arr00' onclick='mINFO(this)'>a - Cross-Posting:&nbsp;</a> <span class='tooltiptext'>Click for more info.</span></span>
				</div>Duplicating a thread or topic in multiple different sections of the forum is prohibited.
				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr00' style='display:none;'>
					Posting identical content in different sections can be interpreted as spam. If you are unsure where to post your content, either post a thread in User Support or ask a staff member for assistance.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>
				<div class='tooltip'>
					<span class="def-span"><a data-ref='arr01' onclick='mINFO(this)'>b - Double Posting:&nbsp;</a> <span class='tooltiptext'>Click for more info.</span></span>
				</div>The act of posting numerous times without another user's response in between is prohibited.
				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr01' style='display:none;'>
					Posting multiple consecutive replies is considered spam. If for any reason you need to add anything to your post, use the edit function to do so. This does not apply if somone deletes their post situated inbetween two of another user's posts, creating the illusion of a double post.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>
				<div class='tooltip'>
					<span class="def-span"><a data-ref='arr02' onclick='mINFO(this)'>c - Single Word Posting:&nbsp;</a> <span class='tooltiptext'>Click for more info.</span></span>
				</div>When posting a thread or a post, more than one word must be used.
				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr02' style='display:none;'>
					When posting, keep your responses elegant and educated. Although we will accept the occasional short, 1-word response, if a user is found to be a repeat offender, a warning will be issued.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>
				<div class='tooltip'>
					<span class="def-span"><a data-ref='arr03' onclick='mINFO(this)'>d - General Spam:&nbsp;</a> <span class='tooltiptext'>Click for more info.</span></span>
				</div>The act of spamming is prohibited.
				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr03' style='display:none;'>
					It is up to our staff to differentiate between legitimate content and outright spam.<br>
					<br>
					The act of vouch posting or owning vouch threads are both considered general spam if there is no extensive justification of why a user is vouching.<br>
					<br>
					The edit function does not safeguard users against previously violated rules. Even if the preceding content was not spam, the staff will consider the post’s current and previous state, resting in their hands the decision of warning the user as they deem fit.<br>
					<br>
					Bumping posts without adding content or information is also considered Spam.<br>
					<br>
					In order to avoid becoming a target of this rule, use common sense. Posts that are too vague, off-topic in relation to the original post, repetitive, short, or useless can and will fall under this rule.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>
				<div class='tooltip'>
					<span class="def-span"><a data-ref='arr04' onclick='mINFO(this)'>e - Wrong Section Posting:&nbsp;</a> <span class='tooltiptext'>Click for more info.</span></span>

				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr04' style='display:none;'>
					Users are expected to use good judgement when posting in forum sections. Please post your thread in a section that best suits your topic. Warnings will be issued depending on the severity of the violation.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>
				<div class='tooltip'>
					<span class="def-span"><a data-ref='arr05' onclick='mINFO(this)'>f - Respectful Posting:&nbsp;</a> <span class='tooltiptext'>Click for more info.</span></span>
				</div>Being excessively and unreasonably mean, rude, or offensive towards other users is prohibited.
				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr05' style='display:none;'>
					Members of the community are expected to treat each other with dignity and respect. Users are encouraged to review their content before posting. We understand that swearing and the use of foul language can be necessary to strengthen a point, and we most certainly don’t want to restrict the way you express yourself, however constant swearing and vulgar remarks in effort to harass other users is forbidden. Excessive vulgarity is unproductive, irrelevant, and prohibited.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>

				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr07' style='display:none;'>

However, we will not tolerate continuation of this behavior when another user expresses annoyance due to lack of understanding.
				</div><br>
				<span class="def-span"></span>

				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr09' style='display:none;'>

				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr010' style='display:none;'>
					Only staff members may determine content that is construed as indecent, vulgar, spam, etc. This rule is not to be confused with ‘minimoding’, or informing users when they break rules - which is permitted if not overdone.<br>
					<br>

If we discover the account(s) before they are reported by the user, all of the users accounts will be permanently banned with the exception of the account with the least content, which will be temporarily banned. If any of the accounts have been permanently banned for any reason other than multiaccounting, all of the users accounts will be permanently banned and the user will not be allowed back on EpticMC.

				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr013' style='display:none;'>

				</div>Rationalization and contemplation play huge roles in the moderation team before issuing a permanent ban.
				<div class='moreinfo' id='arr45' style='display:none;'>
					Since permanent bans are a last resort mechanism, large amounts of speculation and thought are put into reasons for issuing a permanent ban. While EpticMC may consider lifting permanent bans from time to time, this is a very rare circumstance.

					Privacy is important to us, as it is to many of the members of EpticMC. All content posted by any member of this site is to be kept on this site, unless the original poster of the content explicitly says otherwise. In addition, private messages are to remain private, and without explicit permission, content that users email to you privately is to stay between those users, you, and staff members. Some information is private for a reason. Requesting or explicitly asking for private information will not be tolerated.
